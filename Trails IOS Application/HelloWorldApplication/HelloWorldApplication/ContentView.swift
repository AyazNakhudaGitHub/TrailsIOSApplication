    SwiftUI manages the storage of any property you declare as a state. When the state value changes, the view invalidates its appearance and recomputes the body. Use the state as the single source of truth for a given view. A State instance isn't the value itself; it's a means of reading and writing the value.

     SwiftUI uses the @State property wrapper to allow us to modify values inside a struct, which would normally not be allowed because structs are value types. When we put @State before a property, we effectively move its storage out from our struct and into shared storage managed by SwiftUI. This means SwiftUI can destroy and recreate our struct whenever needed (and this can happen a lot!), without losing the state it was storing.
